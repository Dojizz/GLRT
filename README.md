This repo is used to quickly implement a OpenGL program.

Specifically, the project include local GLFW & GLAD, glm, stb_image.h, assimp.
The code should work for OpenGL 3.3 and contain the most basic code about model & image importing, not sure if higher version is supported.

Experiment machine is windows 11 x64, after clone, just use the sln file to
open the visual studio project and build it, the code should run smoothly without any
prerequisite.

Of course, cmake is a better solution, I may implement it after some time :)
